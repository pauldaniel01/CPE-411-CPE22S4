# 💫 About Me:
I am a BS Computer Engineering student at the Technological Institute of the Philippines, driven by curiosity and a quiet determination to improve every day. As someone new to programming, I am currently learning Python and C++, slowly building my understanding one line of code at a time. Challenges and errors are part of the process, but each one teaches me something new and pushes me to improve. I believe growth comes from consistency and effort, even when progress feels slow. This is only the beginning of my journey, and I am focused on becoming better with every step forward.
